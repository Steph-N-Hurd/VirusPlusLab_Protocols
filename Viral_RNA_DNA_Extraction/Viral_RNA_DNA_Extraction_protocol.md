## Purpose:aSaSas

The purpose of this protocol is to extract viral RNA from samples - oral
swab or cloacal swabs taken from a bird usually - that have been stored
in viral transport media (VTM). This protocol is semi-automated, meaning
that half of it is performed by personnel and the other half is
performed on the Thermo Fisher Kingfisher Flex benchtop robot. The
protocol should take about **2-3 hours** to complete with a 47 minute
robot handling time. Two VirusPlus Lab personnel are required for the
performance of this extraction.

| 1           | 1-2 hours before starting: thaw samples in orange rack on counter (benchtop thaw). Samples are from the field, so handle with universal precautions. Print out extraction plate map.                                          |                    |                   |
| 2           | 15 minutes before starting: turn on the blower of the biosafety cabinet (BSC). Remember to place samples in mini-fridge after thaw to keep cool. Treat the hood with RNase Zap as well as the bench space labeled RNAse Free. |                    |                   |
| 3           | Flip sign on door “Low Path Avian Influenza work in progress”. Put on PPE for BSL2+ work: gloves x 2, Tyvek, booties, goggles                                                                                                 |                    |                   |
| 4           | Wipe down the grey counters and Kingfisher robot with RNase Zap to remove enzymes common on surfaces that degrade RNA. Additionally wipe with Quartricide.                                                                    |                    |                   |
| 5           | Retrieve Mag-Bind Viral RNA/DNA Kit from shelf. Use currently open kit before opening new kit. It should be labeled as 'current kit'                                                                                          |                    |                   |
| 6           | Disinfect the BSC. Spray a paper towel with quatricide and wipe all reagents, pipettes, tip boxes and equipment before placing inside BSC, see table on next page for list of reagents:                                       |                    |                   |

| 15          | Load plates into Kingfisher robot. Select “ViralRNA_DNA” program. When prompted load each plate and a new tip comb into the loading stage of carousel. Use the same tip pickup plate as when performing step 7, the maintenance check. The Lysis plate will be missing, close KF door and continue with next steps. |                    |                   |
| 16          | Remove Mag Bind Particles CNR and linear acrylamide from fridge, and vortex only the Mag bind particles for 2 mins (to reduce clumping).

| 21          | On the grey counter outside hood, arrange 22 thawed samples in two rows of 11 in ice bucket. Place the samples lying upright on top of the ice. Place remaining samples back in small fridge for the time being. |                    |                   |
| 22          | Person A: Vortex and opens sample tube with a quatricide sprayed paper towel. Dispose of paper towel after each row of samples, or as needed to maintain sterile procedure.                                      |                    |                   |
|             | Person B: Add 50µl of sample to ‘Lysate’ plate. (Place pipette tip under the surface of lysis solution to prevent aerosolization). Use a fresh P200 tip for each sample.                                         |                    |                   |
| 23          | Add negative controls, i.e. 50uL VTM (or PBS) into column ‘12’ for 6 rows (A through F). Leftover is discarded after plate is finished.                                                                          |                    |                   |
| 24          | Add positive control, i.e. 50uL positive control (PR8 virus) into column ‘G12’ of last row. Leave well H12 blank (to add qPCR control at a later stage).                                                         |                    |                   |
| 25          | Briefly vortex bead solution and pipette into an 8-tube PCR strip (130uL each tube).                                                                                                                             |                    |                   |
| 26          | In your ‘Lysate’ plate: Add 10uL of bead solution to each well. Use the multi-channel P20 pipette with PDF30ST pipette tips. Mix by pipetting up and down twice.                                                 |                    |                   |
| 27          | Load 28. Load lysate plate into KF robot. Press ‘Start’ button to initiate the cycle. Note any changes/notes on the extraction plate maps.                                                                       |                    |                   |
| 28          | Return samples to the boxes in -80. Mark each sample with a slash on lid using a sharpie to indicate a freeze/thaw.                                                                                              |                    |                   |
| 29          | Disinfect hood and all items used during extraction with quatricide. Leave blower on for 15 minutes after the hood has been cleaned out.                                                                         |                    |                   |
| 30          | Make note of reagents that are low or if we need to order more. Submit requests to Quartzy.                                                                                                                      |                    |                   |
| 31          | Come back in ~ 45 minutes to store extracted RNA plate in -80 freezer.                                                                                                                                           |                    |                   |
| 32          | Place extraction map, signed protocl, and any notes in the 'extraction map' binder in 3200 lab space                                                                                                             |                    |                   |

## Disinfecting & Waste Disposal:

33. Clean glass sash of the hood with 70% ethanol.
34. Using sterile procedures, remove PPE, place in appropriate storage
    containers or biohazard waste. Wash hands with soap and water for 20
    seconds. Remove sign as you exit the room.  
35. When the extraction is complete (~41mins), cover elution plate with
    foil (optional: make 50 uL aliquots). Store at 4$^\circ$C for use
    within 2-3 hours. Store at -80$^\circ$C for longer term use.  
36. Dispose of combs and lysate plates in biohazard trash.  
37. Clean the Kingfisher buffer plates for re-use (VHB, SPM and
    tip-pickup). Use squirt bottle with 10% bleach to fill each well.
    Set aside for 15 mins. Discard liquid down the sink. Rinse with warm
    running tap water until wells are clear. Soak plates in quatricide
    overnight (mimic color of quatricide spray bottle (1:64).

<u>Following day 1:</u> 38. Discard liquid down the sink. Rinse with
warm running tap water until wells are clear. Soak plates overnight in
DI water.

<u>Following day 2:</u> 39. Dry upside down on rack above sink. 40.
Place plates inside sterilization pouches and autoclave on dry cycle for
45 minutes.
